        <h1>What Bethany Hamilton means to Me!</h1>

            <p>When her movie, <i>Soul Surfer</i> came out in 2011. I fell in love with everything about Bethany Hamilton and the message she spread of love and faith.</p>
                <br />
                <img id="rolemodel" src="Screen%20Shot%202019-01-14%20at%209.13.15%20AM.png" alt="a phot of me with Bethany Hamilton" Title="We waited that since 6:30 a.m to meet her. We got there so early because it was the first 100 people in line."/>
            <p>Bethany Hamilton became my idol, I watched her movie more times than I can count and can quote the entire film by heart. I have read her book at least 10 times. </p>
            <br />
            <p>I believe that Bethany Hamilton is such an inspiration because she wasn't afraid of the ocean, she wasn't afraid of being attacked again. She was afraid of not trying. That is why Bethany Hamilton is my role model.</p>
                <br />
            <p>When I was 11 years old, my mom found out that Bethany Hamilton was having a meet and greet in Ocean City, New Jersey. She told me and we left at 4:30 a.m and waited 9 hours for her to come. Once she came, I immediately got so happy and can say that it was on of the best days of my life.</p>
